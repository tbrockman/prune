A browser extension to help you trim your garden of tabs.

prune can help you manage your tab growth by:

- Preventing you from opening duplicate tabs (focusing ones you already have open instead!)
- Hiding or removing old tabs (you decide how old is too old!)
- Setting a limit on the number of tabs you have open (pick what works best for you!)
- ...and more! (see "⚙️ advanced settings 🧪")

This project is free, open-source, and can be found at: https://github.com/tbrockman/prune
