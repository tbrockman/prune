# prune

A small Chrome extension to help you manage your garden of tabs.

## Features

- Prevents opening duplicate tabs, `prune` will focus the original for you if you already have it opened.
- Removes old tabs, `prune` will remove any tabs which haven't been looked at for more than 14 days. (`default: disabled`)
- `*new*` Groups stale tabs, `prune` will move aging tabs into a collapsed tab group named `ðŸ•’ old tabs` after 3 days. (`default: enabled`)

`Note:` As the project grows it might help you do *even* more.
