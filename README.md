A small Chrome extension to help you manage your garden of tabs.

## Features

- Prevents opening duplicate tabs, `prune` will focus the original for you if you already have it opened.
- Removes old tabs, `prune` can remove any tabs which haven't been looked at for more than 14 days.
- `ðŸŽ‰ new! ðŸŽ‰` Groups stale tabs, `prune` will move aging tabs into a collapsed tab group named `ðŸ•’ old tabs` after 3 days. -- credit to [@jlo](https://github.com/jeffreyolio) for the prompt to investigate using the tab groups API

As `prune` grows it might help you do *even* more.
