A small Chrome extension to help you manage your garden of tabs.

## Features

- Prevents opening duplicate tabs, `prune` will focus the original for you if you already have it opened.
- Removes old unused tabs, `prune` will remove any tabs which haven't been looked at for more than 5 days.

`Note:` As the project grows it might help you do *even* more.
