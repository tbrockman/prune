## Features

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Some features may not be available due to varying support of extension APIs across browsers

- Prevents opening duplicate tabs, `prune` will focus the original for you if you already have it opened.
- Removes old tabs, `prune` can remove any tabs which haven't been looked at for more than `X` days.
- Groups stale tabs, `prune` will move aging tabs into a collapsed tab group named `ðŸ•’ old tabs` after `Y` days. -- credit to [@jlo](https://github.com/jeffreyolio) for the prompt to investigate using the tab groups API
- Limits number of visible tabs, `prune` can automatically group/remove least recently used tabs if you reach your pre-defined limit
- Bookmarks tabs before removing, `prune` can bookmark any tabs it would've closed, keeping them around a bit longer. -- suggested by [@valyagolev](https://github.com/valyagolev)
- Tips! Help support `prune`'s developer

As `prune` grows it might help you do _even_ more.
